# 🌱 Garden Intro: Planting the First Seed

## 📝 The Concept
This is the "Hello World" of our garden. Before we build complex systems, we need to understand **Variables**.

Think of a variable as a labeled box in your garden shed:
* **`plant_name`**: A box holding the text "Rose".
* **`plant_height`**: A box holding the number `25`.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
* **Variables**: Storing information to use later.
* **`print()`**: Showing that information to the user.
* **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: This is the "Main Gate" of the garden. It tells Python, "Start the program here."

## 💡 Real World Example
We are simply writing a label for a plant and sticking it in the ground so we know what it is.
