# 📋 Garden Data: The Blueprint

## 📝 The Concept
If you have 100 plants, writing `name1`, `name2`, `name3` ... is impossible.
Instead, we use a **Class**.

A Class is like a **Blueprint** or a Cookie Cutter. You make the cutter *once* (`class Plant`), and then you can cut out as many cookies (`rose`, `sunflower`) as you want.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
* **`class`**: The definition (the blueprint).
* **Object / Instance**: The actual thing created from the blueprint (the `rose` itself).
* **`__init__`**: The "Constructor". It runs immediately when you create a new plant to set up its initial data.

## 💡 Real World Example
We defined what a "Plant" looks like (it has a name, height, and age). Then we used that definition to spawn three different plants instantly.
