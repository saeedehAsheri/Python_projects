# Understanding Python Dictionaries

This exercise demonstrates how to build a simple database system using Python's **Dictionary** data structure. Unlike lists, which use numbers (indexes) to find data, dictionaries use "Keys" (like names) to retrieve "Values".

## 1. The Power of Key-Value Pairs
Think of a dictionary like a real backpack in a game.
* **List approach:** You have a bag of items. To find your potion, you have to dump the whole bag out and check every item one by one.
* **Dictionary approach:** You have a magical label. You say "Potion", and the bag instantly tells you "5".

In the code, we use `dict_args` to store this:
```python
{'sword': 1, 'potion': 5, 'shield': 2}
